# Weekday challenges I do from "Codewars" to improve my Javascript and Python skills.

Task:
create a function like the Facebook, Instagram or twitter like feature. Which takes a array containing the names of people that like an item, it must retrun the display text as:

[] --> "no one like this"
["Peter"] --> "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"] --> "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max","John","Mark"] --> "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex","Jacob","Mark","Max"] --> "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

NOTE: FOR 4 OR MORE NAMES, THE NUMBER IN "2 others" SIMPLY INCREASES
